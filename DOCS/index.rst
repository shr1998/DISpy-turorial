DISpy
=============================================
|logo|

DISpy provides an efficient framework for surface-wave dispersion inversion based on distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data. Through an intuitive graphical user interface, users can perform DAS-based ambient noise imaging within a unified workflow, including data reading, preprocessing, cross-correlation computation, dispersion calculation and extraction, and inversion, together with auxiliary functions such as F–K analysis and sensitivity kernel computation.
